In this project, our team collected API daily stock data from Alpha Vantage to analyze if a President has an effect on the stock market.

Hypothesis – If the president influences the stock market, we would expect that the frequency of positive or negative close days, measured from election day to inauguration and total term of each President, would be greater than the market historical average from January 3, 2000 to September 27, 2019.

Null Hypothesis – If the president does not influence the stock market, we would expect that the frequency of positive or negative close days, measured from election day to inauguration and total term of each President, would be equal to the market historical average from January 3, 2000 to September 27, 2019.
