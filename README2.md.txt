Hypothesis:
* Does the president in office influence the stock market?
o Hypothesis – If the president influences the stock market, we would expect that the frequency of positive or negative close days would be greater than the market historical average measured from election day to inauguration, election day to election day and total term from January 1, 2000 to November 26, 2019.

o Null Hypothesis - If the president does not influence the stock market, we would expect that the frequency of positive or negative close days would be equal to the market historical average measured from election day to inauguration, election day to election day and total term January 1, 2000 to November 26, 2019.
